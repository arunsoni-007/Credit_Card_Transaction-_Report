# Credit Card Analysis Dashboard (Real-Time Update Project)

I recently worked on a project analyzing credit card customer details and transaction data.

## Key highlights:
- 1️⃣ Built and completed the initial dashboard.
- 2️⃣ Practiced real-time data addition and updated the dashboard dynamically for the first time.

It was exciting to watch how new data inputs seamlessly updated the analysis, offering practical insights instantly.
